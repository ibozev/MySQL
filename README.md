# RestaurantDatabase

MySQL database for managing articles and orders in a restaurant.

The database stores and manages data related to customers,
waiters, orders and products in the menu.
For the development, I used create table statements, selects, all
types of joins and aggregate functions, group by, having, cascade
updates, also views, temporary tables, triggers and procedures
with inner loops and cursors.

NB: There are also some sample input data. All inputs are in Bulgarian!
