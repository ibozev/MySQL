# RestaurantDatabase

MySQL database for managing articles and orders in a restaurant.

The database stores and manages data related to customers,
waiters, orders and products in the menu.
For the development, I used create table statements, selects, all
types of joins and aggregate functions, group by, having, cascade
updates, also views, temporary tables, triggers and procedures
with inner loops and cursors.

There are also some sample inputs. 

In file tasks.sql are 6 testing tasks using the database 

NB: All inputs are in Bulgarian!
